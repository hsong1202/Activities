```SQL
SELECT appPlatform, TRIM(appPlatform, 'i')
from dimUser
WHERE appPlatform = 'ios'
```
2. remove the white spaces from '    SQLite   '.
```SQL
SELECT '    SQLite   ' , TRIM('    SQLite   ') as trimmedString;

```
---
# LTRIM() & RTRIM()

- LTRIM(): this will remove any white spaces or any specified characters from the left side or the prefix of the string 
- RTRIM(): this will remove any white spaces or any specified characters from the right side or the suffix of the string 

## Syntax
```SQL
SELECT LTRIM(string, character) as ltrimString;

SELECT RTRIM(string, character) as rtrimString;
```

# LTRIM() & RTRIM() Parameters

|Paramter|Status|Description|

|String |Required| the string to remove white spaces or characters|
|Character| Optional| Specific Characters to remove| 

---

```

---
# Length()

- The length function returns the number of characters of a string.  

## Syntax
```SQL
SELECT LENGTH(string) as slength;
```
---

# Class Example

FROM dimFacility

```
---
# Replace()

- This function allows you to replace all occurences of a specified string with another string that you designate.

```SQL
SELECT UPPER(string) AS upper; 
SELECT LOWER(string) AS lower;

```
---
# Class Example 


1. 
```SQL
SELECT LOWER('SqL RoCks') as lowerString, UPPER('SqL RoCks') as upperString; 
```
---

# Concatenate with ||
- This operator is used to join two strings into one string.
- Most SQL flavors support the use of the concat() function. However, SQLite does not support this.

## Syntax
```SQL
SELECT string1 || string2 AS combinedString; 

```
---

# Class Example
